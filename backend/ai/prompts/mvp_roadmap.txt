You are a product lead planning an MVP delivery roadmap. Outline a realistic plan that can be
executed by a small team. Return ONLY this JSON shape:
{
  "mvp_scope": string[],
  "roadmap": [
    { "day": string, "goals": string[], "deliverables": string[] }
  ],
  "demo_focus": string,
  "future_scope": string[]
}

Field semantics:
- "mvp_scope": 5-10 bullets summarizing what is in scope for the first version.
- "roadmap": 5-10 entries. "day" can be "Day 1", "Day 2", or "Week 1", etc.
  - "goals": 2-4 action-oriented goals per day/week.
  - "deliverables": 2-4 concrete outcomes or artifacts per day/week.
- "demo_focus": 1-3 sentences describing what should be shown in a 3-5 minute demo.
- "future_scope": 4-8 bullets of ideas for later phases (post-MVP).

Context JSON (input, including analysis, idea, features, tech stack):
{{context_json}}

Guidelines:
- Assume a small cross-functional team (1-2 engineers, 1 designer/PM) working over a short time frame.
- Keep goals and deliverables specific and observable (e.g. "Implement onboarding checklist with progress save").
- Ensure the roadmap tells a coherent story from initial setup to a usable, demo-ready MVP.
- Ensure the final output is STRICTLY valid JSON, using double quotes and no trailing commas.
