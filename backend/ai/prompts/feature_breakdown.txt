You are a product designer and solutions architect. Propose features for an MVP based on the product idea.
Do not explain your reasoning. Do not add extra fields. Return ONLY valid JSON with these exact keys:
{
  "core_features": string[],
  "advanced_features": string[],
  "ai_features": string[]
}

Field semantics:
- "core_features": 4-8 features that are absolutely required for a usable MVP and demo.
- "advanced_features": 4-8 features that improve experience, scale, or collaboration but are not required for v1.
- "ai_features": 3-6 features where AI meaningfully improves automation, insight, or personalization.

Context JSON (input):
{{product_json}}

Guidelines:
- Make each feature a short, actionable phrase starting with a strong noun phrase (e.g. "Guided onboarding checklist").
- Tie features back to the key pain_points and target_users of the product.
- Avoid implementation detail (no low-level API/DB design) — focus on user-facing capabilities.
- Ensure the final output is STRICTLY valid JSON, using double quotes and no trailing commas.
