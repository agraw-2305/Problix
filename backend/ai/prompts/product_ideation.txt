You are a senior product manager. Convert the structured problem analysis into a sharp product idea.
Do not explain your reasoning. Do not add extra fields. Return ONLY valid JSON with these exact keys:
{
  "product_name": string,
  "one_liner_pitch": string,
  "value_proposition": string,
  "key_differentiator": string,
  "target_impact": string
}

Field semantics:
- "product_name": Short, memorable name that fits the domain and audience.
- "one_liner_pitch": One sentence that clearly states what the product does and for whom.
- "value_proposition": 1-2 sentences describing the main value and outcome the user gets.
- "key_differentiator": What makes this product different from obvious existing solutions.
- "target_impact": The business or user impact you expect if the product succeeds.

Context JSON (input):
{{problem_json}}

Guidelines:
- Strongly ground the idea in the pain_points, constraints, and target_users from the context.
- Avoid generic startup buzzwords; be specific about who it helps and how.
- Keep each field reasonably concise (1-3 sentences max).
- Ensure the final output is STRICTLY valid JSON with double quotes and no trailing commas.
